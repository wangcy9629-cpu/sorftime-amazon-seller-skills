## 1. CLI Call Template

```bash
sorftime api <Endpoint> '<json-params>' --domain <N> --profile <name>
```

| Option | Description |
|------|------|
| `<Endpoint>` | Endpoint name. Use the documented PascalCase form (e.g. `ProductRequest`, `KeywordBatchSubscription`). Gateway routing is **case-insensitive** (`productrequest` and `ProductRequest` both resolve; the official docs even advertise lowercase URLs), and names containing `_` are rejected with 404 — PascalCase without separators is the documented convention. |
| `<json-params>` | JSON string wrapped in single quotes. For endpoints with multiple parameters, non-required fields can be omitted; pass them as required per the endpoint document. |
| `--domain` | Site code (see the table below). Amazon 1-14, Shopee 201-208, Walmart 21, Temu 701/705, 1688 601, TikTok 301-312. **Omitting or passing an incorrect value directly returns 401/404**. |
| `--profile` | Profile name, corresponding to the auth config (containing the token and default domain) created by `sorftime add`. Optional; when omitted, uses the profile currently selected by `sorftime use`. |


**Profile management cheat sheet**:
```bash
sorftime add <profile-name> <api-key>          # Add profile-name
sorftime list                                  # List all profile-name
sorftime use <profile-name>                    # Switch default profile-name
sorftime whoami                                # View current profile-name
sorftime rm <profile-name>                     # Delete profile-name
```

> **Gateway**: the CLI posts to `https://cli.sorftime.com/api/<Endpoint>?domain=<N>`; the open-platform docs publish the same surface as `https://standardapi.sorftime.com/api/<endpoint>` (lowercase). Both are live entry points of the same API — scripts may hardcode either; `cli.sorftime.com` is what the official CLI uses. Response bodies of Shopee/Walmart (and some large payloads) arrive gzip-compressed then base64-encoded; the `sorftime` CLI decodes this automatically (plain-text JSON on stdout), raw HTTP clients must decode manually.

## 6. Common Response Structure

All endpoints return JSON uniformly. **Actual field naming varies by platform as follows**

### 6.1 Amazon / Shopee / Walmart — PascalCase

```json
{
  "RequestLeft": 1052670,
  "RequestConsumed": 5,
  "Code": 0,
  "Message": null,
  "Data": { ... }
}
```

- The Walmart response **additionally** includes a `RequestCount: 0` field (other platforms do not have this field).

### 6.2 1688 / Temu / TikTok — PascalCase on success, camelCase on error

Success response (e.g. `code=0`):
```json
{
  "RequestLeft": 1052670,
  "RequestConsumed": 5,
  "Code": 0,
  "Message": null,
  "Data": { ... }
}
```

Error / no-data response (e.g. `code=11`):
```json
{
  "code": 11,
  "message": "No data available"
}
```

- **Important**: When parsing, support both PascalCase (success) and camelCase (error) naming; case-insensitive access is recommended.

### 6.3 Common Field Description

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| `RequestLeft` / `requestleft` | Remaining request count |
| `RequestConsumed` / `requestconsumed` | Requests consumed by this request |
| `RequestCount` (Walmart only) | Fixed at 0; meaning to be confirmed |
| `Code` / `code` | Business status code, **the only basis for judging success** (see error code table). `0` indicates success; non-zero means a business error. |
| `Message` / `message` | Status description; contains the specific reason on error. |
| `Data` / `data` | Business data; structure varies per endpoint. |

## 9. How Each Endpoint Document References This File

Each `resources/*.md` file's header should consistently include:

```markdown
> For common reference, see [`_common.md`](./_common.md): CLI call template, Domain table, error codes, response structure, rate limits & concurrency. This document covers only parameters and fields unique to this category of endpoints.
```
