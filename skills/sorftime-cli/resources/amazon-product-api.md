## 1. Product basic queries

### 1.1 Product Details (with Product Trend) (ProductRequest)

- **Endpoint description**: Product (listing) details query. Note: when the ASIN does not exist or the link is broken, no data is returned (in this scenario, to confirm the product status, we will fetch the product details in real time); the request still consumes quota.
- **Requests consumed**: 1
- **Supported domains**: 1(us), 2(gb), 3(de), 4(fr), 5(in), 6(ca), 7(jp), 8(es), 9(it), 10(mx), 11(ae), 12(au), 13(br), 14(sa)
- **Request parameters**:
  | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
  |------|------|------|------|
  | ASIN | String | Yes | The ASIN to query. Supports querying up to 10 ASINs at once. When calculating request consumption, fees are charged according to the actual number of ASINs called (2 ASINs charged at 2x, 3 ASINs at 3x, and so on). |
  | Trend | Integer | No | Whether to include trend data in the result (see the fields ending in `trend` in `ProductObject`). 1: includes (default includes), 2: excludes |
  | QueryTrendStartDt | String | No | Optional, valid when `trend=1`. If you want to query trend data after a specific date, set this value. Format: yyyy-MM-dd. Default (when trend is enabled but this parameter is not specified) trend only returns the last 15 days of data; if you need more data, you must specify this parameter. When the requested historical trend exceeds 15 days, request consumption = 2 |
  | QueryTrendEndDt | String | No | Optional, valid when `QueryTrendStartDt` is set (with `trend=1`), represents the query end date, format: yyyy-MM-dd. According to the actual number of days queried from `QueryTrendStartDt` to `QueryTrendEndDt`, when less than or equal to 15 days, request consumption = 1; when greater than 15 days, request consumption = 2 |
- **Usage example**:
  ```bash
  sorftime api ProductRequest '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1
  ```

  - `ListingSalesVolumeOfDaily`: Listing daily sales historical trend from as early as 2021-01-01. For common categories, this field's value is null. When value is -1, it means sales cannot be estimated; possible reason: the selected top-level category is missing, or the top-level category became non-standard (e.g. Our Brands, Amazon Renewed). Example: `[20210101,1000,20210102,1010,20210103,1050,.....]`. Even array indices are dates, e.g. 20210101; odd array indices are estimated daily sales, e.g. 1000. When value is `-1`, it means that day has no estimated sales.

Example: `[20210101,1000,20210102,1010,20210103,1050,.....]`. Even array indices are dates, e.g. 20201001; odd array indices are monthly sales (last 30-day sales), e.g. 1000. When value is `-1`, it means that month has no estimated sales. Note: the response data is the last 30-day sales statistics per day; to view the natural month's monthly sales, you can read the data for the last day of each month.
  - `ListingSalesOfMonthTrend`: Listing monthly sales amount historical trend from as early as 2020-10-01.

## 3. Product reviews

### 3.1 Real-time Collection of Product Reviews (ProductReviewsCollection)

- **Endpoint description**: Real-time collection of product reviews (does not return the collected review content; you need to pull the data through the `ProductReviewsQuery` endpoint. After successful collection of the same product, re-collection is not allowed within 2 hours). Review fetching is divided into two parts: the first step is real-time collection (this step is only collection, not returning specific review content). The real-time collected reviews will be merged with the reviews we have already collected. If you need the latest reviews, we recommend performing collection first; if you don't need the latest reviews, you can skip this step. Credits are deducted based on your collection requirements: 5 credits for each page of reviews successfully collected (10 reviews), and at least 5 credits per launch (even if no reviews are collected, 5 credits will still be deducted). The second step is to pull the review data, through the `ProductReviewsQuery` endpoint to pull all the product reviews we have collected. Since Amazon's control over review data is increasingly strict, the actual collection completion time is at least 2 hours, and at most 7 days.
- **Requests consumed**: 0

  | Star | Integer | No | Filter the collected reviews by star rating. When not passed, it means collection is performed without star rating filtering. When star rating filtering is needed, pass the desired star ratings, supporting multiple filters (comma-separated):<br>1: filter 1-star review collection<br>2: filter 2-star review collection<br>3: filter 3-star review collection<br>4: filter 4-star review collection<br>5: filter 5-star review collection<br>10: negative reviews (1-3 stars)<br>11: positive reviews (4-5 stars)<br>E.g. input: 1,2,3,4,5 means 1-5 stars are collected independently `<page>` pages. Note: credits are deducted on collection: 5 credits for each page (10 reviews) successfully collected. `star` parameter = 1,2,3,4,5 and `page` parameter = 10, then 1-5 star reviews are collected independently, successfully collecting 10 reviews per page (regardless of whether the product has that many reviews, the system still executes the collection task), which would consume 5*10*5 = 250 credits. |
  | OnlyPurchase | Integer | Yes | Whether to only collect reviews from users who have purchased the product, 0: no limit, 1: only reviews from users who have purchased the product. |
  | Page | Integer | Yes | Number of collection pages, optional values: 1 - 10 |

## 6. Product real-time & image search

### Common notes for real-time endpoints

1. **Credit cost**: `ProductRealtimeRequest` consumes credits (2 credits on the JP site, 1 credit on other sites); suitable for real-time monitoring of key products.
2. **Image search**: Only 8 sites are supported (US/GB/DE/FR/IN/JP/ES/IT); submitting a search consumes 0 requests, while `SimilarProductRealtimeRequestCollection` result queries consume 5 credits (6 on the JP site). Note that `SimilarProductRealtimeRequest` and `SimilarProductRealtimeRequestStatusQuery` only support these 9 sites, but `SimilarProductRealtimeRequestCollection` supports all 14 sites.
3. **Real-time fetch time**: All real-time endpoints are expected to take about 5 minutes; for some sites (Middle East (AE) / Australia (AU) / Saudi Arabia (SA) / Brazil (BR)), some trend fields (e.g. ListingSalesVolumeOfDailyTrend) are not yet supported.
4. **Image search tips**: The searched product should occupy greater than 80% of the image and the background should be as clean as possible to improve recognition accuracy.

After a successful fetch, use `SimilarProductRealtimeRequestCollection` to query (each query consumes 5 credits, 6 credits on the JP site) and is expected to return 20+ products.
- **Requests consumed**: 0
- **Supported domains**: 1(us), 2(gb), 3(de), 4(fr), 5(in), 7(jp), 8(es), 9(it)
- **Request parameters**:
  | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
  |------|------|------|------|
  | imageUrl | String | Yes | Publicly accessible image URL (max 1MB), e.g. `"https://example.com/image.jpg"` |
- **Usage example**:
  ```bash
  sorftime api SimilarProductRealtimeRequest '{"ImageUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QWC4JiJRL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg"}' --domain 1
  ```
- **Response data**:
  - `Data`: Actually returns an Integer.

#### 6.2.2 Image Search Status (SimilarProductRealtimeRequestStatusQuery)

- **Endpoint description**: Query the execution status of the image-search similar product task.
- **Requests consumed**: 0
- **Supported domains**: 1(us), 2(gb), 3(de), 4(fr), 5(in), 7(jp), 8(es), 9(it)
- **Request parameters**:
  | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
  |------|------|------|------|
  | Update | Integer | No | Data valid range 1 - 240; check image-search similar product collection task status within 1 - 240 hours of the current time. E.g. 48 means check real-time review collection task status within 48 hours of the current time. |
- **Usage example**:
  ```bash
  sorftime api SimilarProductRealtimeRequestStatusQuery '{"update": 48}' --domain 1
  ```
- **Response data**:
  - `Data`: JSON array format, e.g. `[{ taskId:<task ID returned by ProductReviewsCollection>, status:<task status; 0=collection completed, 4=insufficient credit balance, 11=no collection task, 97=ASIN does not exist, 98=collection failed, 99=collecting>}, ...]`.

## Notes

1. **Batch query optimization**: `ProductRequest` supports querying up to 10 ASINs at once. When multiple ASINs are passed, the fees are charged according to the actual number of ASINs called.
2. **Trend data**: Default returns the last 15 days; to get more data, you must specify `QueryTrendStartDt` and `QueryTrendEndDt`. When the requested historical trend exceeds 15 days, request consumption = 2.
3. **Endpoint rename**: `ProductVariationHistory` has been renamed to `ProductVariations`. The old name still works, but the new name is recommended in new code.
4. **Alexa questions**: See [amazon-alexa-api.md](./amazon-alexa-api.md).
5. **AI result query**: See [amazon-ai-api.md](./amazon-ai-api.md).

## Best Practices

### 1. Batch query ASINs

```bash
# Query multiple ASINs at once (up to 10), saving request count
sorftime api ProductRequest '{"asin": "B0ASIN1,B0ASIN2,B0ASIN3,B0ASIN4,B0ASIN5"}' --domain 1
```

### 2. Competitor analysis workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Query similar products based on an ASIN
sorftime api ProductSearch '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1

# Step 2: Query the competitor's detailed information
sorftime api ProductRequest '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1

# Step 3: Query all variants
sorftime api ProductVariations '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1

# Step 4: Query the Amazon-summarized reviews
sorftime api ProductCustomersSay '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1

# Step 5: Query the officially disclosed variant sales
sorftime api AsinSalesVolume '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1

# Step 6: Pull the latest reviews in real time
sorftime api ProductReviewsQuery '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP", "pageIndex": 1}' --domain 1

# Step 7: AI-interpret the product
sorftime api ProductAssistant '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP", "type": 1}' --domain 1
```

### 3. Real-time update + pull latest data

```bash
# Step 1: Trigger a real-time update (if not updated within 24h)
sorftime api ProductRealtimeRequest '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP", "update": 24}' --domain 1

# Step 2: Query the real-time task status
sorftime api ProductRealtimeRequestStatusQuery '{"queryDate": "2026-07-19"}' --domain 1

# Step 3: Pull the latest product detail
sorftime api ProductRequest '{"asin": "B0CVM8TXHP"}' --domain 1
```

### 4. Image search for similar products

```bash
# Step 1: Submit the image search request
sorftime api SimilarProductRealtimeRequest '{"ImageUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QWC4JiJRL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg"}' --domain 1

# Step 2: Query the task status
sorftime api SimilarProductRealtimeRequestStatusQuery '{"update": 48}' --domain 1

# Step 3: Get the similar product results
sorftime api SimilarProductRealtimeRequestCollection '{"taskId": "<taskId>"}' --domain 1
```
