Note: we exclude some categories that are not suitable for third-party sellers, e.g. apps, audio/video, books, music, food, number games, etc. Combined data description: the data sample is the Top 100 per day within the chosen time range, deduplicated by ParentAsin, with combined product sales: take the product's last 30-day sales statistics on the last day of the time range. Request cost for historical lookup: every 3 days of span costs 10 (day span rounded up). E.g. querying 3 days costs 10, querying 4 days costs 20.

## Notes

1. **Category tree size**: `CategoryTree` returns a very large response (approx. 10MB+); it is recommended to set a long request timeout.
2. **Historical lookup**: `CategoryRequest` historical lookup supports up to 2 years of data, but does not support sites 5 (in) / 12 (au) / 14 (sa).
3. **Historical day span**: `CategoryRequest` historical lookup valid day span range is 3 - 40 days.
4. **Currency minor unit**: All monetary fields (`Price`, `ListPrice`, `Coupon`, etc.) are in local minor units (e.g. on the US site, 1999 = 19.99 USD); missing values return `-1`.
5. **Excluded categories**: We exclude categories that are not suitable for third-party sellers, e.g. apps, audio/video, books, music, food, number games, etc.
6. **AI report eligibility**: `CategoryAssistant` only supports categories where the sum of monthly sales of the top 100 products is greater than 5000 AND the product count is greater than 50; sites 5/11/12/13/14 are not supported.

### 2. Historical Data Analysis

```bash
# Query Best Seller data for the last 10 days
sorftime api CategoryRequest '{"nodeId": "7073960011", "queryStart": "2025-01-01", "queryDate": "2025-01-10"}' --domain 1

# A 10-day span costs ceil(10/3) * 10 = 40 requests
```

### 3. Multi-site Comparison Analysis

```bash
sorftime api CategoryTrend '{"nodeId": "7073960011", "trendIndex": 0}' --domain 1   # US site
sorftime api CategoryTrend '{"nodeId": "7073960011", "trendIndex": 0}' --domain 2   # UK site
sorftime api CategoryTrend '{"nodeId": "7073960011", "trendIndex": 0}' --domain 3   # Germany site
sorftime api CategoryTrend '{"nodeId": "7073960011", "trendIndex": 0}' --domain 7   # Japan site
